# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions for AoC 2019

What I have learnt this year:
- list comprehensions with functools.reduce are nice
- 3 address computer is a beautiful thing
- defaultdict in python is a nice shorthand
- look-up tables are again better than code
- day 7 is a wake-up call for Rust. Done in a rush in Python but I regret that I was not using Rust
